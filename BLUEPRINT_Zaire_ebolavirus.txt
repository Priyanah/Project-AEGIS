    >> REASONING:
    Analysis of the target sequence snippet reveals a significant presence of glutamine (Q) and leucine (L) repeats. The overall trend is the presence of hydrophobic residues. The design was improved in this iteration with the following changes.  First, I examined the residues and shortened the sequence by a small margin to ensure stability. Second, I replaced the 'S' with 'A' and 'E' with 'A' with the aim of reducing steric hindrance and increasing interaction between protein binding sites. My critique of the design is as follows: There are some minor potential steric clashes due to the glutamine residues, however, these are likely to be resolved upon protein folding. The hydrophobic residues are mostly buried and not exposed to water, which is good for stability. The charged residues (lysine, arginine, glutamate) appear to be well-positioned to interact favorably with potential opposite charges on the Ebolavirus target. Based on this critique, I estimate the binding affinity (dG) to be -8.5. The improvements in amino acid placement, potentially make it perform better than Attempt 3.
