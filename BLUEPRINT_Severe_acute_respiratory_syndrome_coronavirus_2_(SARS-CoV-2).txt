    >> MOLECULAR FORMULA:
    KCYGVSPTKLNDLCFTNVYADSFVIRGDEVRQIAPGQTGKIADYNCEFHVKTYRGGGCKYYKLS
    
    >> REASONING:
    Based on previous rounds, a tighter initial interaction with the target's surface is necessary. The snippet 'KCYGVSPTKLNDLCFTNVYADSFVIRGDEVRQIAPGQ' from the original target sequence appears to have strong interaction potential. To create a minibinder, I have shortened the sequence and fused it with an established stabilizing motif 'TGKIADYNCEFHVKTYRGGGCKYYKLS'. This should result in better binding affinity. The 'C' residues allow for future disulfide bridge engineering to further stabilize the minibinder once characterized. Overall, the design should exhibit strong electrostatic interactions with complementary regions on the target while ensuring a stable core structure due to the designed motif. Steric clashes should be minimal, and hydrophobic residues are mostly buried in the core.
