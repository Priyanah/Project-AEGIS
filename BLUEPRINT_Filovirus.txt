    >> MOLECULAR FORMULA:
    CDGLSCTNVCKTVDGLVCQFHQKFSENLQYKVRVVRVDPDFCGKGYHLMSIKSCNSNLCNLTCECEEEKKAEE
    
    >> REASONING:
    Based on previous iterations, the core sequence CDGLSCTNVCKTVDGLVCQFHQKFSENLQYKVRVVRVDPDFCGKGYHLMSIKSCNSNLCNLTCEC shows promise. The target sequence snippet contains several cysteine residues (C) within this region, suggesting a potential for disulfide bridge formation to stabilize the binder. The addition of EEEKKAEE at the C-terminus is intended to improve solubility and potentially enhance binding through electrostatic interactions with complementary positively charged regions on the Filovirus target. The Hydrophobicity of this region needs to be addressed in the future, but this sequence is already an improvement over the previous attempt and should increase the binding score. Potential clashes need to be computationally modeled to verify.
